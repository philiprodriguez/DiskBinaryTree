# DiskBinaryTree
This repository contains DiskBinaryTree* implementations. These are binary-tree-based data structures which do not store themselves on the heap or in memory. Instead, these structures store themselves directly in a file on disk. This allows for drop-in replacement of Java's similar data structures but with "no limits" on how large they can grow since they are represented on disk (yes, they are technically limited in size by how large your disk is).

## DiskBinaryTreeSet
Intended to be similar to Java's TreeSet class, but instead stored on disk. Does not support removal. Implements the Set interface. This is primarily intended for tasks in which you need to insert a ton of items into a set and later query if an item is in the set. The implementation is a self-balancing binary tree (AVL style) so that add and contains operations are guaranteed to always be O(log(n)). Note that since the data is being persisted to disk, there's a fairly large constant factor on that runtime, but do play around with it and you will see overall logarithmic runtime. Also consider editing the implementation's PRINT_DEBUG_INFORMATION constant to true, which will tell you after every insertion the height of the tree :).
